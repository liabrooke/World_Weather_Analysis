# World_Weather_Analysis
Module 6: WeatherPy with Python APIs
## Overview
### Purpose 
###### Jack is the head of analysis for PlanMyTrip & enlisted our help to collect & present data for customers via the search page. We had to collect weather data from over 500 cities across the world to show the relationship between latitude and a variety of weather parameters. This weather data will help customers of PlanMyTrip figure out the best time of year to plan a vacation & best cities to vacation at, while also providing recommendations for hotels based on the customers wants.

### Deliverable 2 & 3?
###### Not sure who grades this, if it's David then thank you a million times over for your help with figuring out why gmaps wouldn't work in Jupyter. However, I just didn't have time to learn gmaps and finish deliverable 2 & 3. Your help did not go to vain though, I am finishing Module 6 and learning the gmaps section. (this is why procrastination is bad, kids)
